# Lab 4: Strings
Due date: Friday 1 February before 6:30pm.

Introduction
The purpose of this lab is to give you some practice working with strings in C.

Complete each of the following programs in your lab4 repository folder according to the comments in each file. (Do a pull to download the starter code to your computer.)

The suggested order for writing these programs is:

compare.c
truncate.c
strip.c
greeting.c
We have provided a Makefile for your convenience. You do not need to change it. If you run the make clean command when you donâ€™t have all the executables built, it will report an error. That is not a problem.

Submission
Remember to commit and push all changes to these files before the deadline. Do not commit any executables or any other files.
